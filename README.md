## **Configuration Options**

- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE 
- `Theme Aspect Ratio` - sets the aspect ratio the theme will render at. If needed, this can be changed to match the aspect ratio of your screen (though it should happen automatically).
   - `16:9`, `16:10`, `4:3`, `1:1` and `19.5:9` are supported
- `Theme Variant` - sets the layout used for the gamelist view when media & metadata are scraped for your games.  There are 2 variants to choose from:
   - `Grid` - A grid game selection with detailed metadata.
   - `Carousel` - A carousel game selection with detailed metadata.
- `Theme Color Scheme` - sets the color scheme that is used for the overall theme on all views.  There are 4 built in color schems to choose from:
   - `Dark` - A dark grayscale color scheme.
   - `Light` - A light grayscale color scheme.
   - `SteamOS` - Based on the primary colors used in Steam OS.
   - `Shinretro Dark` - Based on the shinretro dark theme.
- `Theme Font Size` - enables you to change the size of the fonts displayed in the theme. There are 2 sizes to choose from:
   - `medium`
   - `large`

## **Theme Customization**

- Create a folder called `theme-customizations` in the main shinretro theme folder and then create a subfolder named `artwork` resulting in a folder structure `~ES-DE/themes/shinretro-revisited-es-de/theme-customizations/artwork/`
- Copy your custom carousel images to that `artwork` folder
- They should be named `${system.theme}.webp`, For example for `snes` you would create an image called `snes.webp`
  - Note that custom images only need to be supplied for the systems to be customized and the default system image will be used for any other systems.
  - The carousel images use an aspect ratio of 0.65:1 so if images that are provided use a different aspect ratio to this they will be cropped which may cut off parts of the image and not look good.
- Change the theme color scheme to one of the color schemes with `Custom` in the name and the artwork from the custom folder will be used.
