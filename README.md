- `Theme Color Scheme` - sets the color scheme that is used for the overall theme on all views.  There are 4 built in color schems to choose from:
   - `Dark` - A dark grayscale color scheme.
   - `Light` - A light grayscale color scheme.
   - `SteamOS` - Based on the primary colors used in Steam OS.
